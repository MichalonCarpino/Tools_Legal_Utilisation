# ONYPHE 

"ONYPHE is a Cyber Defense Search Engine for open-source and cyber threat intelligence data collected by crawling various sources available on the Internet or by listening to Internet background noise. ONYPHE does correlate this information with data gathered by performing active Internet scanning for connected devices and also by crawling Web site URLs. It then normalizes information and makes it available via an API and its query language." as they discribe themselves.

it can be used directly with the web browser....

First, onyphe makes it possible to know which informations are accessible directly and indirectly from everywere, more or less easily. There is a lot of results and the analysis can get long and tedious. To use these informations effectively, others tools will have to be used, but these exploits may be illegitimates and therefore illegals. Let's highlight  that an entity can do those kind of researchs towards itself; however, it's no sure that this is still legal if this same entity does the same types of researchs towards another distinct entity.
