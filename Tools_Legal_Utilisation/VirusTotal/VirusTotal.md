VIRUSTOTAL:

After recovering different types of malware on the "any run" platform, we wanted to try to analyze them via VirusTotal.
As a reminder, VirusTotal is a website that analyzes suspicious files and facilitates the quick detection of viruses, worms, trojans and all kinds of malware detected by antivirus engines.

Procedure followed :
- let's download on the platform the malwares in .zip format
- for each file, extract the suspect file,
- on the VirusTotal website: select the file 
- launch the analysis and observe the analysis of the site


Here is an overview of the VirusTotal analysis:

The selected samples are in the following formats: pdf, .exe, .bin, .xlsm, .ace
Analysis of a file : 
type: .exe
malware type : Troyan
Number of antivirus which detected : 59/71
Graph of relation of malware:

After analysis of the 5 files we can see :
the antiviruses that detect the most are: AVG, BitDenfender theta, McAfee-GW-Edition, Fortinet
knowing that the analysis is carried out on a precise route at the launching of the analysis, it appears sometimes differences of result for the same file but for two different analyses (ex: the number of antivirus varies from one analysis to another)
